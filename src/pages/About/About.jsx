                The Classical Art Research Centre (CARC) is one of the strategic research units of the Oxford University Faculty of Classics. Our purpose is to stimulate and support fresh research on many aspects of ancient Greek and Roman art, as well as hosting our own projects. We provide physical and virtual archives and databases, web resources, conferences, workshops, and publications, serving an very global audience beyond Oxford.

                CARC was created out of the Beazley Archive in 2007, when the Archive was moved into specially designed premises in the Ioannou Centre for Classical and Byzantine Studies, next to the Ashmolean Museum in central Oxford. The Beazley Archive contains the world's biggest photographic archive devoted to ancient Greek figure-decorated pottery. This Archive, and the online Beazley Archive Pottery Database (BAPD) remain at the heart of CARC's activities.

                <p className="text-base leading-8 my-5">
                The Beazley Archive is built around the academic papers and photographs of Professor Sir John Beazley (1885-1970), who was Lincoln Professor of Classical Archaeology and Art at Oxford from 1925 until 1956. The Archive contains around 100,000 photographs of ancient Greek (mainly Athenian) painted pottery, as well as relevant books and offprints, extensive material on the history of gem-collecting, and thousands of other documents and photographs relating to classical archaeology and to Beazley's own career. The majority of the Archive's images are available online, but the physical photographs remain a resource of central importance for research on classical art. Every year CARC welcomes researchers from all over the world, who come to examine the photographs and other archival material. </p>
                <p className="text-base leading-8 my-5">
The Archive was purchased by the University of Oxford while Beazley was still alive, in 1964. On his death in 1970 it was moved to the Ashmolean Museum building, where it quickly became an internationally renowned centre for the study of Greek vase-painting. It was augmented by archives associated with other classical archaeologists, including eventually John Boardman, Llewelyn Brown, Stanley Casson, TJ Dunbabin, Paul Jacobsthal, Elfriede Knauer, and Norbert Kunisch.   </p>
<p className="text-base leading-8 my-5">
From 1979,  computers were used to document Athenian figure-decorated pottery, initially supplementing Beazley's own work and then growing into a database that included and built upon it. In this way the Beazley Archive Pottery Database was born. It was a relatively early development in humanities computing and the data structure and lists of terms developed for it have been the foundation on which other databases have been created since 1992. They have also been made available to other projects working on databases and interoperability elsewhere.   </p>
<p className="text-base leading-8 my-5">
In 1998 the BAPD became available on the World Wide Web and other databases and online resources were developed, including a database on ancient and neoclassical engraved gems.   </p>
<p className="text-base leading-8 my-5">
The launch of the Classical Art Research Centre in 2007, as an umbrella for the Beazley Archive and other activities, led to a wider range of initiatives, including new projects and regular events aimed at supporting and stimulating fresh research on all aspects of Greek and Roman art. Today the physical and online archives remain central to CARC's work, but it has grown into a dynamic international centre for the study of ancient art and the exchange of ideas in the field.
